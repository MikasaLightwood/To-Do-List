 To-Do List App
 
 Project Description

The To-Do List App is a simple web-based project created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It demonstrates the use of object constructors and prototypes in JavaScript to manage a list of tasks.
The app allows users to add, complete, and delete tasks while displaying them dynamically on a web page.

Purpose

The project focuses on understanding how JavaScript can be used to create and manage objects, apply prototype methods, and interact with web page elements.
It provides a basic example of combining structure (HTML), styling (CSS), and logic (JavaScript) in a single project.

Features

Add new tasks to a list.

Mark tasks as completed.

Delete tasks when no longer needed.

Display example tasks when the page loads.

Project Files

index.html – the main web page structure.
styles.css – contains the design and layout styling.
script.js – includes the JavaScript logic for task management.

Functionality

The app uses a constructor function to create task objects.
Prototype methods are applied to handle actions such as adding, marking, and deleting tasks.
Each time a change occurs, the interface updates automatically to reflect the current list of tasks.
